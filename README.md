# 👋 Hi, I'm Laurette Mhlanga!
🔬 **Epidemiologist | Infectious Disease Modeler | Data Scientist**

I am a **Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Northwestern University** specializing in **infectious disease modeling, spatial data analysis, and machine learning**. My research focuses on applying **mathematical and statistical models to optimize public health interventions**, particularly in low-resource settings.

🔍 **Key Areas of Expertise:**
- 🦠 **Malaria & HIV modeling** using Bayesian and machine learning approaches
- 🌍 **Geospatial analysis** for infectious disease surveillance
- 📊 **Predictive modeling** for epidemiological forecasting
- 📈 **Shiny dashboard development** for interactive data visualization
- 🏥 **Health policy impact analysis** for intervention planning
