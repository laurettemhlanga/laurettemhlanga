# Hi, I'm Laurette Mhlanga!
**Epidemiologist | Infectious Disease Modeler | Data Scientist**

I am a **Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Northwestern University** specializing in **infectious disease modeling, spatial data analysis, and machine learning**. My research focuses on applying **mathematical and statistical models to optimize public health interventions**, particularly in low-resource settings.

 **Key Areas of Expertise:**
- **Malaria & HIV modeling** using Bayesian and machine learning approaches
- **Geospatial analysis** for infectious disease surveillance
- **Predictive modeling** for epidemiological forecasting
- **Shiny dashboard development** for interactive data visualization
- **Health policy impact analysis** for intervention planning

## Featured Projects

 **[MRPT (Malaria Re-Prioritization Tool)]**  
_A decision-support tool for malaria intervention planning._  
- Developed using **R Shiny** for **interactive geospatial analysis**
- Integrates **machine learning, small-area estimation, and composite score models**
- Supports **offline processing** for malaria programs in low-resource settings

 **[Spatial Epidemiology Models]**  
_Using geospatial and statistical models for disease burden estimation._  
- Implements **spatial regression models** for epidemiological forecasting  
- Uses **GIS techniques** to identify high-risk malaria transmission areas  
- Built with **R (`sf`, `raster`, `spdep`) and Python (`geopandas`, `folium`)**

**[Machine Learning for Disease Forecasting]**  
_Applying ML algorithms to predict health outcomes._  
- Uses **XGBoost, LightGBM, and Random Forest** for malaria risk prediction  
- Incorporates feature selection techniques to optimize model performance  
- Implements **cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning**  

 **[Sentiment Analysis for Health Research]**  
_Analyzing text-based health data using NLP._  
- Uses **`tidytext`, `sentimentr`, and `textTinyR`** for sentiment classification  
- Compares **lexicon-based** and **ML-based sentiment scoring methods**  
- Processes public health survey data to analyze community responses
